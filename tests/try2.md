Guillermo del Toro supports Christopher Nolan's stance on the importance of physical media, especially following controversial actions by streaming platforms that have removed certain films from their services. Nolan has expressed concerns over the lack of permanent ownership with digital distribution, highlighting the security of owning physical copies like 4K UHD or Blu-ray discs. Warner Bros. faced criticism for pulling original movies off HBO Max and cancelling films like "Batgirl" and "Scoob! Holiday Haunt," with tax write-downs taken for both. The creative community and fans reacted strongly, with backlash and movements like #ReleaseBatgirl. Nolan worries about filmmakers whose work is exclusive to streaming services and may disappear. Del Toro equates owning physical media with the responsibility of preserving films for future generations, akin to memorizing books in Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451." Nolan is currently promoting the physical release of his film "Oppenheimer," which includes special features and behind-the-scenes content.
