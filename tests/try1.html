    <p class="lead">Ridley Scott has faced criticism from French critics over his latest movie "Napoleon," which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character. The film explores Napoleon's rise to power and his relationship with Empress Jos√©phine, portrayed by Vanessa Kirby. While IGN gave the film a 7/10, noting it as a historical epic with a strong lead performance, French reviews were less favorable, with some calling it "anti-French" and a "pro-British" rewrite of history.

In response to the negative feedback, Scott has been dismissive, particularly of historians questioning the film's accuracy, famously retorting that unless someone was present during the events, they should remain quiet. He defends certain historical liberties taken in the movie for storytelling purposes, such as a scene where Napoleon fires cannons at Egypt's pyramids. Scott has also advised those fixated on inaccuracies to "get a life" and appears to be gaining attention for his candid comments during the movie's promotion.

Joaquin Phoenix suggests that while the film presents Napoleon through Ridley Scott's vision, those interested in the historical figure should research on their own to truly understand him. Ridley Scott's blunt responses to his critics have been making headlines and, to some extent, turning him into an internet meme.</p>
