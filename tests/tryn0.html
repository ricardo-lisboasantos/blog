    <p class="lead text-justify">Game of Thrones enthusiasts are feeling increasingly pessimistic about the completion of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series as George R.R. Martin has not made significant progress on "The Winds of Winter." Despite having been expected to finish the novel within three years after the 2011 release of "A Dance With Dragons," Martin has confessed to struggling with the writing process. The same 1,100 pages reported complete in 2022 remain unchanged a year later, and there's the final book "A Dream of Spring" still to write. Conversations on Reddit reflect a shared sentiment that the series may remain unfinished, with Martin admitting to the monumental task of writing due to the expansive story. While some suggest he may need assistance, possibly even from a ghostwriter or AI, Martin's current lawsuit against OpenAI for copyright infringement indicates he might be reluctant to delegate the work. Despite focusing on "The Winds of Winter," Martin's non-page count progress includes revisions and planning, suggesting that work continues on the book alongside his involvement with Game of Thrones spin-off shows.</p>
